# Android-Malware-Detection

**About the Project Android Malware Detection:**
We propose a malware detection using traditional classifiers (Support Vector Machine, RandomForest, XGBoost, etc.) and neural network on complex model(Multi-layer perceptron(MLP) on NATICUSdroid dataset. The goal of this project is to improve the security of mobile devices and protect users from the ever-increasing threat of malware attacks.

**Implementation of machine learning models and neural network model that are applied for the Android Malware Detection:**
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Extra Tree
4. Gradient Boosting
5. Extreme Gradient Boosting
6. Decision Tree
7. AdaBoost
8. Support Vector Machine
9. Gaussian Naive Bayes
10. Multi Layer Perceptron

**Prediction Model:**
Lime Prediction Model: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) is a well-known technique for illuminating the forecasts of powerful machine learning models. For each prediction, LIME offers a way to generate a local, instance-level explanation, which may assist in improving the model's predictability and transparency. LIME's advantage is that it offers a flexible and adaptable technique to create explanations that are adapted to the particular requirements of the application and the users.

**Service Development to detect the Android Malware:**

Once we have a model in place to make predictions, any end-user should be consuming that model with a viable medium like an easily accessible Application/API endpoint. For this project, we built small web application which will accept the Android manifest file and perform XML processing to extract all the permissions that are required by that particular android application. These permissions will be fed into model and then trained model will predict whether given instance of android application is Malware or not.

**Process of Execution:**
1. First need to download the dataset data.csv
2. In the Jupyter Notebook open the code file and can check the results of our project of models and the prediction model.
3. Run the app.py file and upload the manifest files to detect that particular permissions has malware or not.
